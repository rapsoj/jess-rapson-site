I led a team to collect data on the impact of various policy changes on global emissions and develop an R Shiny app to simulate which combinations of structural and behavioural changes need to be made to achieve Paris Agreement targets.

# Project Overview

| **Motivation** | Despite the promises of international climate agreements, greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere continue at record levels, committing the planet to dangerous future warming |
| **Data** | Produced country-level simulations of COâ‚‚-equivalent reductions for specific proposed emission reduction strategies |
| **Client** | Climate researchers and policymakers |
| **Status** | In Progress |
| **Outcome** | TBD |
