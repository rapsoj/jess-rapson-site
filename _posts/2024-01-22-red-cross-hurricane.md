I am working with the Red Cross to improve their impact-based forecasting (IBF) model for typhoon damage in the Philippines. The goal is to make the model sensitive to errors in decision-making such differences in failing to protect an impacted municipality and spending money to unnecessarily protect an unaffected municipality are considered.

# Project Overview

| **Motivation** | The current model for predicting cyclone damage in the Philippines recommends actions based on a damage threshold that is not sensitive to the costs of forecast errors |
| **Model** | A cost-sensitive model that considers the differences in value for failing to protect an impacted municipality or spending money to unnecessarily protect an unaffected municipality |
| **Client** | International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) |
| **Status** | In Progress |
| **Outcome** | TBD |

The Philippines are struck by 20 typhoons a year on average. Climate change is intensifying the effects of these storms and several reach the category of ’super typhoon’. Impact-based forecasting (IBF) is one of the mechanisms used for triggering early actions. IBF means turning forecasts and warnings from descriptions of what the weather will be into assessments of what the weather will do.
