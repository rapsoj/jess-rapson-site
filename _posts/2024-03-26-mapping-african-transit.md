I am leading a research group to digitalise and analyse public transit routes in major Africa cities for DigitalTransport4Africa. The goal is to provide information to make public transit more accessible to residents and produce analytical insights for urban planners.

# Project Overview

| **Motivation** | The lack of transit data in developing African cities presents a major barrier to improving and accessing transportation |
| **Data** | Digitalised maps of African transit systems with data-driven metrics for evaluating public transit accessibility |
| **Client** | DigitalTransport4Africa (DT4A) |
| **Status** | In Progress |
| **Outcome** | TBD |

Most African urban areas rely on some form of informal or semi-formal transport. However, only 15 African cities have mapped their public transport systems in a standardized and open format, meaning that over 105 million people do not have reliable transit information. The lack of data presents a major barrier to improving and accessing transportation.
