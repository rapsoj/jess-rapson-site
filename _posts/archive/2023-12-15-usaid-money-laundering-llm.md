The requisite financial product knowledge for detecting and preventing international money laundering can be incredibly complex. To make this information more accessible to investigators and regulators, I am developing a question and answer large language model that can aid in explaining these topics to relevant parties.

# Project Overview

| **Motivation** | International money laundering is a highly complex topic where misunderstandings from investigators and regulators can have serious consequences |
| **Model** | A large language model trained on publicly available data to aid investigators and regulators in understanding product risk for international money laundering |
| **Client** | United States Agency for International Development (USAID) |
| **Status** | In Progress |
| **Outcome** | TBD |

Financial products are used to launder proceeds of corruption through the international financial system, diverting precious resources for the benefit of the political elite and their enablers. While corruption harms everyone, those living in poverty and marginalized communities are often the worst affected by corruption, with 63&#37; of young people surveyed by the African Union having paid bribes to access essential services such as healthcare or education. Over \$3 trillion is lost to corruption annually, with an average of 7.5&#37; of foreign aid leakage, and only 1&#37; of illicit assets are seized. Corruption threatens sustainable development, democracy, peace, trust in public institutions and causes human misery and harm.

Given the complexity and proliferation of financial products, there is a need for a holistic anti-money laundering (AML) financial product database and tool to help identify characteristics that make a product vulnerable to misuse, that can cut down time in carrying out new product risk assessments, and can be used to identify preventative AML measures to train compliance teams and investigators. Corrupt schemes could significantly be reduced if more information and transparency around financial products, including flow of funds diagrams and money laundering risks and controls became more readily available.
