Universal basic income (UBI) has been proposed as a potential solution some of the biggest threats faced by modern workers: wage inequality, job insecurity â€“ and the looming possibility of AI-induced job losses. I led a team to collect data on tax policies for G20 countries and develop an R Shiny app to simulate different taxation paradigms.

# Project Overview

| **Motivation** | Understanding the impacts of taxation reform requires a highly specific understanding of existing taxation and benefit schemes, yet most governments do not digitise their various taxation policies |
| **Data** | Developed methodology for digitising a wide variety of tax systems and produced analytical simulations for G20 countries |
| **Client** | PolicyEngine |
| **Status** | In Progress |
| **Outcome** | TBD |
