introduction: |
  
  I am a machine learning engineer with a multidisciplinary background in both statistical science and public policy, focusing on applications of AI/ML in optimising decision-making processes for organisations that serve the public. This website is intended to be an informal showcase for some of the projects I've worked on, and maybe some other creative stuff.

  I have worked on a wide variety of projects:

  - Machine learning tools to inform infrastructure funding decisions for [Infrastructure Canada](https://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/index-eng.html)
  - Predictive AI to improve global governance effectiveness for the [G7 Research Group](http://www.g7.utoronto.ca/about/index.html)
  - Data science in humanitarian aid and global development for the [Future Impact Group](https://futureimpact.group/)
  - Research into developing novel spatio-temporal forecasting methods for the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/)

  I have [Master of Public Policy](https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/mpp) degree from the University of Toronto and a [Master of Science in Statistical Science](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-statistical-science) degree from the University of Oxford. Please contact me if you want to collaborate!
